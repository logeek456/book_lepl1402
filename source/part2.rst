Software testing
================

What is software testing?
-------------------------

According to the ANSI/IEEE standard 610.12-1990, *testing*  is *"the process of operating a system or component under specified conditions, observing or recording the results and making an evaluation of some aspect of the system or component"*. More informally, testing means verifying that software (or hardware) does what we expect it to do. 

As an example, let's assume we have written a method to calculate the quotient *a/b* of two natural numbers *a* and *b*:

..  code-block:: java

    static int division(int a, int b) { ... }
    
Now, we want to know whether our implementation is correct. We can call the method with arguments 6 and 3 and maybe we get 2 as result. This seems to be correct. Then we call the method with arguments 12 and 3, and we get 4. This looks fine, too. Finally, we call the method with arguments 5 and 2 and we get 3. Is that correct? Or did we expect the result to be 2? And what should be the result if the arguments are 4 and 0?

As the above example shows, tests are only useful if we have defined what our program is supposed to do. There are different ways to specify the expected behavior of software:

1. We could write a formal specification. In our example, this is relatively easy because the method performs a simple operation. Our formal specification could be:

    .. math::

        division(a,b) = \left\{\begin{array}{cl}\lceil\frac{a}{b}\rceil & if b\neq 0\\error\  exception,& otherwise \end{array}\right.

  According to this specification (note the :math:`\lceil\cdot \rceil`), it becomes clear that the method should return 3 when called with arguments 5 and 2, and it should throw an exception if the second argument is 0. 

2. Especially for more complex programs that are difficult to describe in a formal way, the specification is often written in the form of a text document with sentences like *"The method returns the quotient of two natural numbers..."*.

3. Finally, when working with customers, we often have to start with a list of *user requirements*, i.e., a description of what is need (*"The program should calculate a/b"*), and we have to write our own specification from that.

Requirements can come in all kinds of forms. In general, we can distinguish two broad categories of requirements:

- **Functional requirements** describe **what** the final product must be able to do. Examples:

  - "The program should calculate *a/b*"
  - "The program should sort a list"
  - "The program should print the first five prime numbers"
  
- **Non-functional requirements** describe **how** the product should perform. Examples:

  - "The program should be easy to use"
  - "The program should not need more than 10 milliseconds to calculate *a/b*"
  - "The program should be secure"

What can be tested?
-------------------

Tests can be performed at different levels. Our above test of the :code:`division` method is a *unit test* because methods are the smallest entities in Java that we can independently test. We could also test an entire class or package (this is called a *module test*), several packages (*integration test*), or an entire program (*system test*). In this book, we will only do unit tests.

In general, the larger and the more complex the program you are testing, the more complicated the tests will be, and, more importantly, the more time-consuming it will be to fix a bug. A unit test can be done as soon as we write the method, and if we find a bug we can change the implementation of the method relatively easily. Imagine if we first finished writing the whole program and then, after several months of development, found during a system test that the program violates the specification! In the worst case, this could mean rewriting the whole program.

For this reason, it makes sense to start testing as early as possible in the form of unit tests. However, it should be noted that unit tests do not replace the other tests, because some errors appear only when we combine several methods or classes.


How to plan a unit test
-----------------------

We test software because we want to verify that it produces the correct results (functional requirements) in the right way (non-functional requirements). In general, software like our above :code:`division` method takes one or more input values and produces one or more result values. Unfortunately, in many cases there are many possible input values and testing our software with all of them would take a lot of time.

In practice, we can only test our software on a few input values and hope that the software also works correctly for other input values. For example, when we call our :code:`division` method with the arguments 6 and 3 and we get the correct result, we assume that the method also works correctly with the arguments 12 and 6. On the other hand, if the result for 6 and 3 is not correct, we know that our software contains a bug that we have to fix.

Does that mean that we should test our :code:`division` method with just two random numbers? No, we can do something smarter than that:

1. First, we determine the *input domain* of the method, i.e., the set of possible input values. Because the method has two :code:`int` parameters, the input domain is :math:`\{-2^{31}..2^{31}-1\}\times \{-2^{31}..2^{31}-1\}`.

2. Then we split the input domain into interesting sub-domains. For example, we could decide it is interesting to test whether our method works correctly for :math:`b=0`. In that case we would obtain two sub-domains:

    - With :math:`b=0`: :math:`\{-2^{31}..2^{31}-1\}\times \{0\}`
    - With :math:`b\neq 0`: :math:`\{-2^{31}..2^{31}-1\}\times \{-2^{31}..2^{31}-1\} \backslash \{0\}`

3. Instead of testing all possible input values, we choose a few input values from each subdomain for the test, for example :math:`a=3, b=0` for the first sub-domain, and :math:`a=6, b=3` for the second sub-domain.

This approach also works for more complex methods. Let's take the following one:

..  code-block:: java

   static int[] sortArray(int[] array)
   
Clearly, the input domain is very large. It contains all arrays of any length :math:`n\ge 0` containing all possible integer values. Possible sub-domains for testing could be:

1. The empty array (:math:`n=0`)
2. Arrays with one element (:math:`n=1`)
3. Arrays containing random unsorted numbers for :math:`n>1`
4. Arrays containing numbers that have been already sorted, like :code:`{1,2,3,4}`, for :math:`n>1`
5. Arrays containing numbers that have been already sorted in descending order, like :code:`{4,3,2,1}`, for :math:`n>1`

Itâ€™s always good to have disjoint sub-domains that cover the entire input domain. Our second sub-domain already covers the case :math:`n=1`, therefore it is not necessary to cover that case again in sub-domains 3 to 5.
